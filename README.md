# amrita_events_flutter

An app that, if you're a student of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, when built, will help you keep in touch with, learn more about and register for workshops, cultural events and other happenings in and around the campus. 

The app is in development right now, and contributions are welcome. It's supposed to look like this: [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/CDh8J9WTpD8x2rSagsOiGi/Events-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=508%3A1479&viewport=288%2C-963%2C0.17&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=508%3A1479&show-proto-sidebar=1)
